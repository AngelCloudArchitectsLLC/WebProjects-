Executive Summary

I am seeking a startup loan of $16,000 at an interest rate of 8% to fund my new business venture, which provides coding education for children. This business will operate both online and in-person, teaching kids the fundamentals of Python programming. To enhance engagement and encourage learning, I will conduct regular giveaways of popular gaming credits such as V-bucks, Roblox, and Minecoins.

This business is poised to meet the growing demand for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) education, especially as parents look for innovative ways to prepare their children for the future. The requested funds will be used to cover initial expenses such as technology infrastructure, marketing, and materials for teaching.

Products/Services:
	•	Python coding lessons for kids (ages 8–16)

Target Market:
My primary audience includes children ages 8 to 16, with a focus on tech-savvy parents who value STEM education. The combination of learning and gaming incentives makes this a unique offering that appeals to both children and parents.

Market Opportunity:
	•	The global coding education market is expected to grow significantly in the coming years, driven by increasing interest in technology-related careers.
	•	There is an unmet need for accessible, engaging coding lessons for kids in rural areas like Salina, Kansas, as well as the potential to scale the online platform nationwide.

I am seeking $16,000 in startup capital to cover the following:
	1.	Technology Infrastructure: $6,000
	•	Laptops, webcams, and software tools for online coding instruction.
	2.	Marketing and Advertising: $3,000

Loan Terms Requested

I am confident that this business has strong potential for success, with an anticipated return on investment within the first 18 months. I have already identified several parents and schools interested in enrolling their children in my programs.
